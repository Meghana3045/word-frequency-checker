Back then, Liu Furong was still a small team leader. However, he had already caught the eyes of their regiment commander." Little Four had looked up the report Liu Furong's regiment commander had written about Liu Furong. One could tell that the regiment commander saw potential in Liu Furong and wanted to help him in his development.

"If it wasn't for the fact that Magic Ace Mecha Clan was completely decimated 15 years ago from an enemy ambush, Liu Furong might even have developed to be even more monstrous than now…" Those, who were team leaders from other mecha clans weaker than Magic Ace Mecha Clan, had already become regiment commanders of ace mecha clans by now. Some even became generals. Liu Furong on the other hand only had his rank upgraded, but was still only just a team leader.

"What happened 15 years ago has affected Liu Furong greatly. Although he led a broken team out of the ambush, he instantly went unconscious after getting out because of exhaustion. After he woke up, his memory of the battle was all mixed up. He was treated at the main military hospital for 5 months and then was discharged to rest at home."

"Five months? Then, when he was discharged, it was already September, when w.a.n.g Baozhuang and w.a.n.g Qi arrived on Planet Muyang." Ling Lan saw the files Little Four had shown her and suddenly remembered what Aunt Liu had told her. Liu Furong had once mentioned that his regiment commander was powerful. He didn't mean Ling Lan six years ago! Instead, there wasn't any regiment commander that he had admired after Magic Mecha Clan was completely wiped out 15 years ago. Liu Furong would always go through different clans and he had never stayed for more than one year in each one. After joining 250 Ace Mecha Clan in the 23rd Division, he finally stopped moving around.

"Little Four, check the files on the regiment commander of Magic Ace Mecha Clan." The most crucial person was this regiment commander.

"The regiment commander's name is called w.a.n.g Junan…" Little Four brought out the file on w.a.n.g Junan and handed it to his Boss.

Ling Lan read through w.a.n.g Junan's file quickly. She saw that before he was KIA, his wife was 6-months pregnant… She gave birth to a son in June.

"A baby boy?" Ling Lan looked at the picture of w.a.n.g Junan and quickly had w.a.n.g Qi's image appear in her minds.p.a.ce.

"Don't the two of them look alike?" Ling Lan finally found a hint of some sort.

"Somewhat." Little Four looked back and forth between the two images. He felt that when the two of them stood together, they did indeed look similar.

"Then, that makes sense." w.a.n.g Baozhuang, w.a.n.g Qi and w.a.n.g Junan. They were willing to change their names and yet still didn't want to change the name of the regiment commander's son? It seemed w.a.n.g Junan was really admired by the soldiers in the clan. Even a logistician from a different clan was willing to help him even if it meant death.

"The files on the battle back then were almost all gone. Even if there are some files, they are limited in information. Not sure whether it was because those involved had perished or someone had meddled with the information and purposely hid it away." Little Four couldn't find any detailed records on battle that completely wiped out Magic Ace Mecha Clan.

"Of course someone meddled with the files! It's just we don't know whether those who meddled with it was helping them or their enemies," Ling Lan said with a frozen expression.

If the military wanted to know something, they would definitely get to the bottom of it. They were playing dumb on purpose since there weren't any details about it. The military would rather let a t.i.tled ace mecha clan get wiped out without any reason than to investigate to get to the bottom of this. It seemed that this issue had a lot of politics involved.

Ling Lan was in dismay. She was only running away from home to have some peace and quiet. She didn't want to do anything to upset the balance of the world. Why did G.o.d hate her and always create problems for her?

Ling Lan knew that she was amidst a huge problem now…

"Little Four, you unlucky little thing, why did you chose Planet Muyang?" Saddened, Ling Lan pinched Little Four's pink cheek and began to rub it furiously to quell her feeling of dismay.

"H-ow suold I rnow (How should I know)…" Little Four felt wrongly accused. Although the galaxy map was created by him, wasn't it still his Boss that pointed to this planet? How come he was to blame now?

"Boring, not as nice to pinch as Little White." Ling Lan disliked the fact that Little Four's face was not as chubby and wasn't as stretchy as Little White's face.

"Right, since we're talking about Little White, it has been playing around with Aijun recently. Does it not want to leave with us?" Ling Lan thought whether she should use this chance to toss away this dumb and cute pet.

"Not sure, but Little White goes out to the surrounding area of the town everyday for adventures with Little Jun." Little Four told Ling Lan what Little White had been up to these past few days.

"It's having a lot of fun, huh." It wasn't even think about her, his master, one bit. Ling Lan was disheartened that she kept a good for nothing pet. However, she wasn't apologetic about how she was just thinking of ruthlessly abandoning Little White.

"Rawr!" She suddenly heard Little White's angry roar. This was the difference of spiritual power. Other than Ling Lan or experts in spiritual power, the average person wouldn't be able to hear it.

"Not good!" Ling Lan's expression changed instantly. Little White was informing her that someone was making a move on Liu Aijun.

Ling Lan disappeared from the room and appeared at the location where Little White had screamed in the next second. However, she only discovered the gra.s.s and trees around her were a mess, while Little White and Liu Aijun were nowhere to be seen.

Ling Lan put out her finger, closed her eyes and felt the presence that was still lingering in the air…

"The earth element is quite thick here…" Ling Lan immediately knelt down and pushed her right hand into the ground to feel the changes in the earth element.

"Who knew that a small planet like Muyang would actually have an earth element domain realm master. Plus, he is at least a t.i.tled domain realm master if he could kidnap Liu Aijun and Little White from my watchful eyes."

Right as Ling Lan felt the enemy's location, she heard a loud explosion coming from the Liu family's home.

Ling Lan's concentration was disrupted. Now, the trail she had caught on from the earth element domain realm master instantly brokne off. She sensing it again, but she could not sensed it

anymore.

"Sh*t!" Ling Lan could only give up on searching and run back to the Liu family's house. She saw the originally old and tattered home of the Liu family had already become a pile of debris.

Aunt Liu was sweeping the yard at the time. Although she was sent flying by the shockwave produced by the explosion, she was not hit with anything. She didn't have any life-threatening injuries and was quite lucky.

Seeing Ling Lan appear, Aunt Liu, who was dumbstruck and had a blood smear on the corner of her mouth, instantly regained her focus. She cried happily, "Jiang Hui, it's a good thing you're okay." Just now, she actually thought Jiang Hui had perished in the explosion. That was because in her mind, Jiang Hui should have been in the guest room eating breakfast.

Ling Lan helped Aunt Liu up and brought her to rest in the open area outside. She then took out a vial of medicinal agent and gave it to Aunt Liu as she comforted her, "Aunt Liu, I'm fine. This is medicine for treating your wounds. Rest for now."
If the computer chip didn't have the information that Planet Azure's Central Scout Academy operation had failed, Ling Lan wouldn't have been able to put two and two together.

The operation on Planet Azure was to secretly send spies into the military. Then, what is the reason for them to put men on Planet Muyang? Is their target actually Mai'er Fa?

Although Mai'er Fa was a lone planet, it still didn't have any natural resources. There were only countless casinos. Even if the profits of the casinos were abundant… Just from the large base that was in the forest showed that this faction didn't lack the funds and would not care about such a place…

'Perhaps their goal is not only Mai'er Fa. There is definitely a hidden goal!' Thinking to this point, Ling Lan couldn't help but sigh. Her information was still lacking. That was why she couldn't predict the organization's real goal from the data she had. If it was her father, Ling Xiao, he would probably be able to find a hint of some sort.

Ling Lan didn't waste anymore time to think about it since she couldn't figure it out. Ling Lan also felt exhausted not only from killing people in the night, but also using her brain power to think. Seeing that it was still early, she closed her eyes to rest.

"Knock, knock, knock." The door to her room was suddenly softly knocked on. Ling Lan slowly opened her eyes and discovered that it was already bright outside.

Ling Lan got up and opened the door. She saw Mother Liu holding today's breakfast while standing at the door.

"Jiang Hui, this is your breakfast for today." Mother Liu walked into the room and put down the food. However, she didn't turn around like she had done the previous mornings and instead stood there as though she had something to say.

"Aunt Liu, you have something you want to say?" Ling Lan was curious.

"Well, Jiang Hui, I just want to ask. Have you ever heard of the name Liu Zhongguo out in the galaxy?" Mother Liu frowned as though something was worrying her.

"Aunt Liu, you know that there are many people who joined the military. Unless we meet accidentally, or perhaps told by the military, otherwise, we wouldn't know of just anyone," Ling Lan said helplessly. She ,of course, couldn't tell Aunt Liu that the name 'Liu Zhongguo' was found by Little Four as KIA( Killed In Action) 15 years ago. However, all of that information was wiped clean. Even if Mother Liu was to go Planet Muyang's task force headquarters to search for him, she wouldn't be able to find any information.

"I know. When Aijun was born, something happened in the family. I had no choice but to go to the task force headquarters. However, I couldn't find anything on Zhongguo… After that I stopped searching," sighed Mother Liu. Back then, she was hurt emotionally. Her husband, the father of her children, actually deceived her. He didn't actually become a soldier…

"I heard Aihua telling me that you travel everywhere and go on adventures. That's why I wanted to ask you whether you've met Aihua's father. If he's not in the military, then I suspect that he probably became a part of some galaxy's adventure mercenary group. Six years ago, I caught wind from him saying that his regiment commander was very powerful. From that I deduced that he's within a group or a team." If he wasn't in the military, then he was probably in a mercenary group. "This is his picture. I secretly took a photo while he was sleeping. Aihua's father didn't like to leave any photos or videos of himself behind." Liu Aihua carefully took out a photo from her pocket.

The man in the photo had long hair hanging on his shoulders and his features were well rounded. He was a handsome man, but he had a large beard around his face which covered half of his face. This beard made him look lazy. He had his eyes closed while he was sleeping, but he still had a frown on his face. It was as though he was intensely thinking about something… Ling Lan's hand trembled as she took a look at the photo. She looked at it carefully many times. After confirming there was nothing wrong with her suspicions, she bit her lip and shouted into her minds.p.a.ce, "Little Four!"

"Here!" When Little Four heard his Boss's tone was odd, he immediately put aside what he was working on and appeared before Ling Lan in an instant.

"a.n.a.lyze the person on the photo and find out who he is!" Ling Lan said coldly. Someone actually disguised his ident.i.ty and committed such a crime… Ling Lan felt a burning rage rising from her chest.

"Roger." Little Four quickly scanned the picture in Ling Lan's hand, then erased his beard. After that, he cut his hair, revealing a clean forehead. Just like that, the handsome looking man appeared in Ling Lan's minds.p.a.ce.

"What? It's actually Captain Liu!" Little Four couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

"Very good. Very good. I didn't think that 250 Ace Mecha Clan would have such a person within it…" Ling Lan's eyes were ice cold.

Although Ling Lan was angry in her mind, her face still had a huge smile, "Aunt Liu, Uncle Liu is quite handsome. It's no wonder that Aijun and Aihua are so beautiful."

Hearing this, Aunt Liu instantly blushed. She said embarra.s.singly, "Back then, one half of the reason why I got together with your Uncle Liu was because of this."

"However, your Uncle Liu didn't like to take care of himself and was messy everyday. I've told him many times." When Aunt Liu spoke of her husband, her tone was still somewhat sweet.

'He didn't like to take care of himself? Messy? 'Ling Lan thought of Liu Furong's clean and straight uniform, even his subordinates were clean and spiffy… It was hard for her to connect the person Aunt Liu was telling her about with Liu Furong.

'What secrets does Liu Furong conceal? Is he actually Liu Zhongguo or is that an impersonator?'

"Little Four, investigate Liu Furong. Get everything on him!" Ling Lan ordered Little Four in her minds.p.a.ce. It wasn't only for Aunt Liu's family, but also for Liu Furong and 250 Ace Mecha Clan.

"Yes, Boss!" Little Four instantly had an adrenaline rush and began working on it.

Little Four lit a candle in his mind for Liu Furong. Once his crime was confirmed, Captain Liu would definitely die a gruesome death.

Ling Lan handed the photo back to Aunt Liu, "I will keep an eye out Aunt Liu. If I see Uncle Liu, I will definitely tell him to come back and see you guys." Ling Lan squeezed the words 'Uncle Liu' out the cracks between her teeth.

Aunt Liu took the photo and carefully put it away safely. She then smiled, turned around and left. Although she knew that the likelihood of Jiang Hui finding her husband was slim, she could still have hope right?

"Boss, I found everything on Captain Liu. There's nothing wrong with his records." Little Four took out all the files on Liu Furong and didn't find anything that was meddled with.

"That means Liu Furong is real!" Ling Lan slammed the table and went into deep thought.

"Liu Zhongguo isn't fake too!" Little Four continued, "Although the two of them were in different divisions and with different experiences, they still had one time stamp that was the same."

Little Four put together the time Liu Zhongguo was KIA along with time when something happened to Liu Furong's clan, "They both happened 15 years ago in April."

After suddenly remembering something, Little Four took out w.a.n.g Baozhuang and w.a.n.g Qi's files as well, "They also entered Planet Muyang 15 years ago, but they arrived in September."
