Although Nannuo Yao hated Lin Chujiu, she was not someone who doesn’t know how to deal with the situation. Seeing that Lin Chujiu was really treating her wounds, she slowly let go of her guard, which she can barely do so. She was dizzy, so she no longer endures it and just let herself fell to sleep… …


Lin Chujiu took a glance at Nannuo Yao but didn’t say anything. She just continued doing her job at hand.


Personal grievance was a personal grievance, work was work. Although Lin Chujiu hated Nan Nannuo Yao, she doesn’t bring such emotion at work. Lin Chujiu responsibly cleaned up the wound, suture them, and then applied the medicine… …


Throughout the process, Lin Chujiu didn’t avoid the maidservant’s eyes. In front of her, she sutured the b.l.o.o.d.y big wounds again and again.


When Lin Chujiu finally stopped, the maidservant pointed her finger to the wound and said: “This, is the wound alright? Is our princess alright?”


“Your princess is fine.” After cutting the surgical thread, Lin Chujiu exhaled.


She was dead tired.


“Take a clean cloth and wipe my sweat.” Her nose and forehead were all sweaty. She didn’t feel it earlier while working, but now she felt uncomfortable.


“Yes, yes, yes.” The maidservant busily came forward and wiped her sweat attentively.


After taking a short break, Lin Chujiu took off the b.l.o.o.d.y gloves on her hands: “Your princess is in good health. Just let the doctor prescribed good medicine to support her. After a quarter of an hour, I will take care of your princess’s other illness.”


She was a moral person. Since Nannuo Yao promised to leave the East Country, she will also keep her promise.


Well, even if she doesn’t to, she can’t help it. The medical system will not let her go until she does this minor operation.


“Now, now?” The maidservant’s hand shook when she heard what Lin Chujiu said.


Isn’t Princess Xiao tired?


“You still want to pick a lucky day?” Lin Chujiu sat on the chair with closed eyes. She leaned on the chair and rested her tired hands. She didn’t touch anything else.


The maidservant didn’t dare to say another word, she just quietly stood to the side. She also looked at Nannuo Yao’s situation from time to time.


After a quarter of an hour, Lin Chujiu opened her eyes and washed her hands carefully with warm water. She waited for her hands to dry naturally before she put on her surgical gloves.


“Take off your princess pants.” When Lin Chujiu said this, there was no embarra.s.sment. Instead, it was the maidservant who got shocked for a moment. But then, she understood what Lin Chujiu meant, so she obediently took off Nannuo Yao’s pants.


Lin Chujiu had checked Nannuo Yao’s condition before. She knew her condition very well, so she was not surprised when she saw the lower part of her body.


After unpacking the surgery kit, Lin Chujiu took two hours to complete this minor operation because she has no a.s.sistant. During the treatment process, the maidservant looked at Lin Chujiu with confused eyes. Unfortunately, Lin Chujiu was working so seriously, so she didn’t saw the doubt in her eyes.


However, even if she doubted her, will she risk her life to stop it?


After the second operation was dealt neatly, Lin Chujiu let the maidservant get a clean skirt for Nannuo Yao to wear: “Don’t put on underwear until the wound completely healed.”


The two diseases were treated altogether, which saved Lin Chujiu time to explain too much.


“Is this alright?” The maidservant got a little uneasy with Lin Chujiu’s strange way to treat the patient.


Princess Xiao’s treatment is strange, is it really effective?


“She’s fine. In the future, your princess can marry and have children without any problem.” Lin Chujiu just checked the medical system, Nannuo Yao’s uterus had no problems.


“Really, really?” The maidservant looked surprised as if she couldn’t believe it.


Lin Chujiu packed her things, she didn’t answer the maidservant’s question. She just gave her instructions on how to take care of Nannuo Yao and advised her not to let the wound open.


She was exhausted!

No spoilers, please!
Matt's sudden attack surprised everyone in the hall.

Sure enough, he can't help himself. Fang s.h.i.+han pitied s.h.i.+ Feng when she noticed Matt's attack.

Matt was incredibly talented, and after working with the h.e.l.l Training System, the lastest training system Mythology had created, his already violent tendencies had become more prominent. Now, he was a combat maniac.

Even in Mythology, there were few people who could spar with Matt. With a neutralizing grandmaster before him, the man was naturally eager to spar with s.h.i.+ Feng. He had recently gotten closer to becoming a Henglian grandmaster and hadn't had the chance to test his strength properly. Before s.h.i.+ Feng made his decision was the best opportunity for Matt to force the younger man into a fight.

Although stopping Matt wasn't impossible, Fang s.h.i.+han thought it was necessary for s.h.i.+ Feng to experience Mythology's power.

Lei Bao, who stood by s.h.i.+ Feng's side, felt stifled when he saw Matt's punch. This strike was completely different than the hits Matt had used during their fight. Not only did this punch break the sound barrier, but it also seemed impossible to avoid.

Lei Bao thought he could even hear the Grim Reaper call his name.

However, just as Matt's. .h.i.t was about to land, s.h.i.+ Feng casually took a half step back and rotated his right shoulder as if he had expected the attack. Almost as if an invisible barrier had manifested between them, Matt's punch harmlessly stopped a few centimeters away from s.h.i.+ Feng's shoulder.

"What? Did I scare you?" Matt quipped when s.h.i.+ Feng hadn't made another move to stop him. "What happened to all of your confidence?"

Matt was only a half-step Henglian grandmaster, and although he was more physically fit than ordinary neutralizing grandmasters, his mental processing couldn't compare. His senses and reaction speed were just as inferior to that of a neutralizing grandmaster.

If a neutralizing grandmaster focused on evading his attacks, Matt would be helpless against them. In fact, if Lei Bao, a peak internal force master, had focused on evasion, their fight would've lasted a lot longer.

This was why Matt had deliberately challenged s.h.i.+ Feng to last three of his punches. Otherwise, fighting s.h.i.+ Feng would be a waste of time.

"Forget it, Matt. Hall Master s.h.i.+ can't take your hits. I suggest you face each other in a race. At least that will give Hall Master s.h.i.+ a chance at victory," the tall, short-haired woman behind Fang s.h.i.+han ridiculed.

The woman's provocation enraged Heaven's Rumble's disciples.

Even veteran neutralizing grandmasters couldn't help to match a half-step Henglian grandmaster's physical fitness, much less s.h.i.+ Feng, who had only recently become a neutralizing grandmaster. Asking s.h.i.+ Feng to take a direct hit from Matt was a joke.

Xiao Yu began to move forward to advise s.h.i.+ Feng against falling into the woman's trap. If he fell for it and lost against Matt, Heaven's Rumble's reputation would be in tatters.


"I never said I wasn't interested. I just don't think those terms are fair," s.h.i.+ Feng said, shaking his head. "I have to sell Zero Wing's shares if you win, yet you'll just pack up and leave if you lose. What benefit do I get for accepting this challenge?"

"That's simple. Head Instructor s.h.i.+, if you win, I'll give Zero Wing a 300 million loan, plus state-of-the-art training equipment for the Heaven's Rumble Training Center. I can guarantee that the equipment I have to offer rivals that in the country's top dojos and training centers," Fang s.h.i.+han declared, her lips curling into a wicked grin. She reacted as if she had been expecting s.h.i.+ Feng to ask.

"State-of-the-art training equipment?" Xiao Yu's eyes glowed when he heard this.

Three hundred million Credits would be a ma.s.sive boon to the Heaven's Rumble Training Center, but the state-of-the- art equipment would be far more important.

The equipment Fang s.h.i.+han offered might not be worth 300 million Credits, but it was impossible to purchase on the market. Only the suppliers' partners had any access. In comparison, the best equipment available to the public was two generations behind, which was why ordinary training centers and dojos' disciples couldn't hold a candle to those from top dojos and training centers.

If the Heaven's Rumble Training Center could get its hands on this equipment, its facilities would undergo a qualitative transformation. In turn, this would make the training center more attractive to far more people.

s.h.i.+ Feng didn't respond immediately, however.

"What? You're still not satisfied?" Fang s.h.i.+han chuckled at s.h.i.+ Feng's silence. "If that's not enough, state your demands, Head Instructor s.h.i.+."

She already had a good grasp on Heaven's Rumble Training Center's situation. Although Lei Bao normally led the training center, and Heaven's Rumble's members received excellent training, it was nothing compared to the nation's top dojos and training centers, particularly when it came to its training facilities.

If Heaven's Rumble acquired state-of-the-art equipment, its facilities would be an excellent promotional tool on their own, luring in far more members. s.h.i.+ Feng had no reason to reject her offer. Zero Wing desperately needed manpower, after all.

Fang s.h.i.+han a.s.sumed that the only reason s.h.i.+ Feng hadn't jumped at her offer was that he wasn't confident in withstanding Matt's punches. Knowing this, she wouldn't give the younger man any excuses to refuse her challenge.

Everyone in the hall thought the same.

They had already witnessed Matt's power. Everyone would be impressed if s.h.i.+ Feng remained standing after taking a single hit, let alone three.

"Since Miss Fang has asked, I only have one condition," s.h.i.+ Feng said, smiling. "He must withstand three of my palm strikes, as well. If you win, Zero Wing will sell its shares. If I win, I want 20 bottles of Life Potion!"

For a moment, shocked silence filled the training hall.

"Are you insane?!" the tall woman behind Fang s.h.i.+han blurted, staring at s.h.i.+ Feng.

"Hall Master?!" Even Lei Bao gave the younger man an incredulous look.

Henglian Style pract.i.tioners were not famed for their strength, but for their frightening defense. It was why a Henglian master would dare to fight a neutralizing grandmaster, yet refused to acknowledge apex internal force masters.

Matt was only a half step away from reaching grandmaster status in the Henglian Style, and as such, his skin and bones were as solid as steel. Trying to injure him with human strength was an utter joke. Only bullets could break though his hide now.

"Twenty Life Potions?" Fang s.h.i.+han frowned.

Life Potions weren't like S-rank Nutrient fluids. They contained an extraordinary amount of life force. Consuming one bottle of Life Potion would restore youth to an ordinary person, and the potions were in high demand among grandmaster martial artists. Even a major corporation like Qilin Corp. could only secure a small number of bottles. Despite being the Qilin Corporation's princess, Feng s.h.i.+han didn't even get that many Life Potions per year.

"If Miss Fang thinks this condition is too demanding, we can forget about this challenge," s.h.i.+ Feng mused, chuckling.

Neither the Credits nor the state-of-the-art equipment was a priority for Zero Wing and Heaven's Rumble right now. The organizations would only truly be able to develop further by improving the strength of their current combatants.

The Life Potion was undoubtedly one of the quickest ways for Zero Wing and Heaven's Rumble to do so. As long as Zero Wing and Heaven's Rumble became strong enough in the future, obtaining state-of-the-art was entirely possible if they were willing to spend a little money, but that wasn't the case for the Life Potions. They were truly rare items. Not even Lu Xingluo, the Starline Corporation's heir, could acquire many Life Potions, much less s.h.i.+ Feng.

"Fine! I agree to your condition!" Fang s.h.i.+han hissed. Smiling, she continued, "But remember, you only have three palm strikes!"

"Of course." s.h.i.+ Feng nodded.

"You really think you can win, kid?" Grinning, Matt said, "Even if I stood here and let you hit me 20 times, you couldn't force me to take a single step back, much less three!"

However, before Matt could say anything more, s.h.i.+ Feng walked up to him and thrust out his palm.

The strike looked light and gentle from an outsider's perspective; it didn't look like it had the power to threaten anyone. That thrust didn't even look like it could injure an ordinary pa.s.serby, let alone Matt.

However, just as s.h.i.+ Feng's palm was about to connect with his target, the movement changed, leaving three afterimages in its wake.

Thud!

A dull sound echoed throughout the hall, and Matt's face lost color until his complexion was a deathly pale. He stumbled three steps back, clutching his abdomen as he fell to his knees, unable to speak for a long moment...
