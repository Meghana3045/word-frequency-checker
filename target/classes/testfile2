However, whether it was Emperor Ji's headquarters or the Ji Estate, they were dizzy with work and were madly searching for Ji Xiuran's whereabouts. Combined with the fact that a tremendous number of factions also dropped by the area to obtain more information, no one had any time to receive Ye Wanwan or anyone for that matter.

To avoid causing trouble for Emperor Ji's faction and the Ji family, Ye Wanwan had no choice but to leave and stop disturbing them.

Although Ye Wanwan didn't feel any adoration for Emperor Ji anymore and had given her whole heart to Si Yehan, Ji Xiuran was her benefactor. Without Ji Xiuran, where would she be today?

Hence, Ye Wanwan was immensely worried about Ji Xiuran's disappearance.

When she returned to the Fearless Alliance, she immediately dispatched a lot of members to help search for Ji Xiuran's whereabouts. She was aware that the impact would be minimal, but she and the Fearless Alliance had to do something at a time like this or else she wouldn't be able to rest easy.

Ji Xiuran truly provided a lot of warmth to Ye Wanwan, especially when she just arrived in the Independent State-a stranger in a strange place. When she was asking a tiger for its skin in the Fearless Alliance, it was Ji Xiuran who stayed by her side and helped her gain a better understanding of the Independent State and the Fearless Alliance, allowing Ye Wanwan to develop a better chance of survival. This warmth was familial, and their feelings for each other were like that of an older brother and a younger sister. Normal people might not comprehend it, but Ye Wanwan understood it.

Inside the office, Ye Wanwan's face was so dark that ink could drip from it. Her chilly and sinister eyes stared outside the window. She swore that if someone dared to harm Ji Xiuran, she would rip them into shreds!

"Actually, Sis Feng, there's one more matter."

The quiet Seven Star spoke up after a lengthy silence.

"What is it?" Ye Wanwan asked with a frown.

"Sis Feng, Big Brother Wen Ziran left for a long time, and logically speaking, he should've returned long ago. However, there hasn't been any news from him recently, and when the Fearless Alliance attempted to contact Big Brother Wen Ziran these last few days… they couldn't reach him at all," Seven Star replied.

"Sis Feng, Brother Ziran isn't dead, right?" Big Dipper was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with worry.

Big Dipper and Seven Star were led by Wen Ziran after Ye Wanwan left the Independent State, so they had a superb relationship.

Seven Star turned to Big Dipper. His lips drew open as though he wanted to say something but couldn't utter a word.

It was hard to accept this kind of result, but it wasn't improbable.

Ye Wanwan couldn't remember Wen Ziran at all, but she knew Wen Ziran was her sworn elder brother.

Wen Ziran was also known as the number one fighter in the Fearless Alliance, so she wagered that she couldn't defeat him back then…

How could a fighter like that disappear and die?

"Many strange things have indeed happened in the Independent State lately, Sis Feng. Heavenly Owl's boss, the leaders of some top-notch, long-established factions, and even Emperor Ji and Big Brother Wen Ziran all disappeared peculiarly. Is there a connection here?" Seven Star started a.n.a.lyzing the recent situation in an attempt to calm himself down.

"Old Seven, are you saying it's the same group of people behind the disappearances of all these bosses and big shots?" Big Dipper stared at Seven Star incredulously. What kind of cosmic joke was that?!

"I also think it's inconceivable, but it isn't improbable. If this is true, are Emperor Ji and the others currently still alive… or gone from this world?" Seven Star asked.
Chapter 1976 Emperor Ji goes missing

"Sis Feng, why are you calling? Heavenly Owl's boss went missing!" Big Dipper hastily interjected.

"Huh? Went missing?" Ye Wanwan was astonished and caught off guard.

"That's right, she went missing. It happened just in these past two days, and the people from Heavenly Owl thought it was the Fearless Alliance who did it since Heavenly Owl's boss only lowers her defenses against us, the Fearless Alliance. Aside from the Fearless Alliance, it's impossible for even a power like Asura to abduct Heavenly Owl's boss without any notice!" Big Dipper said with a sigh. "…" Ye Wanwan mused to herself. This is seriously a disaster falling from the sky unwarranted, even though all I was doing was sending messages in my office! Heavenly Owl's boss is incredibly friendly toward the Fearless Alliance, so why would the Fearless Alliance abduct their boss? Are the people from Heavenly Owl missing their brains?!

"What does Heavenly Owl's missing boss have anything to do with us? Are those people stupid?" Ye Wanwan was incensed.

Although the Fearless Alliance often did this kind of thing, the target mattered, alright? Heavenly Owl's boss had such a good relationship with her back then and helped her so much when she founded the Fearless Alliance, so there was no way she would do such an utterly heartless thing regardless of how wretched she was!

Soon, Ye Wanwan received news that several higher-ups from Heavenly Owl had come to the Fearless Alliance.

Ye Wanwan didn't slack off and immediately greeted the higher-ups. When faced with their inquisition, Ye Wanwan swore that their Fearless Alliance absolutely wasn't the culprit.

After getting rid of those higher-ups from Heavenly Owl, Ye Wanwan instantly ordered Second Elder to bring some people and investigate this matter. They better not discover someone was intentionally framing the Fearless Alliance for this.

Moreover, the Fearless Alliance was indebted to Heavenly Owl's boss, so they had to find her!

However, in the following two days, many famous and powerful figures in the Independent State subsequently went missing one after another, as though they evaporated into thin air. All contact with them was cut, and there wasn't any news of them no matter how hard people searched.

Until the third day…

Inside her office in the Fearless Alliance, Ye Wanwan stared at First Elder in shock.

"That's… absolutely impossible." Ye Wanwan was incredulous.

"President, it's true. It's absolutely true… Emperor Ji went missing… last night…" First Elder repeated with a frown.

Ye Wanwan could understand it if the boss of Heavenly Owl and some veteran factions in the Independent State went missing, but when it was Emperor Ji's turn…

Who was Emperor Ji?

Ji Xiuran was the heir to the Ji family, one of the Independent State's four great clans, and the emperor of all of Europe's underground powers-a frightening figure who could nearly control all of the Independent State with a crook of his finger. But he actually… went missing?!

"Emperor Ji really went missing?" Ye Wanwan was still unwilling to accept this unbelievable truth.

"Yes, President, Emperor Ji did indeed go missing. Not only that, but there's news that he fought with someone intensely before going missing since there was a lot of fresh blood inside the room. It's also been verified that blood is Emperor Ji's." First Elder had a deep frown on his face.

A person like Emperor Ji held immense power and lorded over the Independent State, but he mysteriously disappeared in his own territory, even leaving behind a large amount of his own blood at the crime scene. That was enough to shock every faction in the Independent State.

After receiving news of Emperor Ji's disappearance, Ye Wanwan didn't hesitate and immediately ordered Big Dipper to drive her to Emperor Ji's headquarters and the Ji Estate.
Her drinking this time was slightly different from the past. Before, her memory blacked out directly after she got drunk, but her memory wasn't exactly blacked out this time. If she thought about it carefully, she could faintly recall some scenes; they were just very unclear. She wondered whether it was related to how a portion of her memories was recovered.

"Did anything else happen? Um, did Lord Asura say something?" Ye Wanwan asked as she turned to the group.

Big Dipper shook his head. "I don't think so. Lord Asura mainly told me to cover you with a blanket because it's chilly so you might get cold or something… Wait, Sis Feng, why would Lord Asura tell me to cover you with a blanket for no reason? He must've had some nefarious motive for acting so nice…"

Ye Wanwan glanced at Big Dipper, unwilling to waste her words with him.

She quickly opened the office door and told them to leave and rest. After all, they stayed up the whole night because of her and hadn't slept yet.

After everyone left, Ye Wanwan picked up her cellphone and stared at the phone contact named "Owner of the Independent State's Vinegar Factory" for a brief moment before dialing.

The call connected, but no one picked up the phone. Ye Wanwan refused to give up and persistently kept calling, but during the third attempt, the other end directly rejected the call!

A fury instantly ignited inside Ye Wanwan. He's become fully-fledged, huh? I can forgive him for not picking up my call, but now he's intentionally rejecting my call, huh?!

Si Yehan, you're too terrible!

Ye Wanwan hmphed. Fine, reject my call! It's not like I want to call you! If you're so capable, ignore my calls for the rest of your life!

Although Ye Wanwan couldn't continue calling him, the messages didn't stop. She started bombing him with messages, starting from "What are you doing?" and "Have you eaten yet?" and ending with straight-up hara.s.sment. However, Si Yehan didn't answer a single message.

It wasn't until Seven Star and Big Dipper's arrival in the afternoon that Ye Wanwan decided to show mercy on Si Yehan for a moment and stopped her mad a.s.sault.

"Sis Feng, something bad happened."

Seven Star was the first to talk after entering her office.

Ye Wanwan was startled. Why did something bad happen every day?

"What now?" Ye Wanwan asked nonchalantly.

"One of our partner factions stopped all partnership with the Fearless Alliance today," Seven Star elaborated.

"Stopped all partnership?" Ye Wanwan was astonished. That didn't sound right. The Fearless Alliance had always had decent relationships with its collaborative partners, so why would a faction abruptly halt all collaborations?

"Which faction?" Ye Wanwan asked with a frown. This was a stomp on the Fearless Alliance's pride.

"Sis Feng, it's Heavenly Owl!"

"Heavenly Owl?!"

Ye Wanwan was surprised. Heavenly Owl was an extremely long-established faction in the Independent State, and its power wasn't inferior to that of the four great clans. Actually, Heavenly Owl could be considered the Fearless Alliance's big brother. When the Fearless Alliance was initially founded, Heavenly Owl provided a lot of a.s.sistance to the Fearless Alliance.

Moreover, the Fearless Alliance had an exceptionally amicable relationship with Heavenly Owl. They had been business partners for many years without any problems, so why were they stopping all business dealings with them now?!

If it was some other faction, the Fearless Alliance could confront them directly, but Heavenly Owl was different. It was the Fearless Alliance's big brother…

"Let me make a call and ask," Ye Wanwan said.

Although Ye Wanwan didn't have her old memories, she had shared a few meals with Heavenly Owl's leader, a female boss that Ye Wanwan admired immensely and respected, so it shouldn't be a big problem for her ask about the reason.

After the emperor realized that it’s impossible to control the rumors about the crown prince and Princess Fushou Zhang. He brought out a big event to divert people’s attention.


Xiao w.a.n.gye disappeared on the battlefield!


A few days ago, Xiao Tianyao, after entering the dense forest, they lost contact with him. His whereabouts were unknown after he was pursued by the northern army.


When this news broke out, the people in the capital got scared. “It’s impossible. How come Xiao w.a.n.gye disappear? This is impossible.”


“We don’t believe it, we don’t believe it, but Xiao w.a.n.gye is the G.o.d of War in East Country. How come he disappear?”


“The intelligence on the front line must have got it wrong, Xiao w.a.n.gye can’t have an accident!”


The battles in the front line were a national event in the East Country. So from the officials up to n.o.bles and ordinary citizens, they all became crazy with this news. At this time, no one remembers the crown prince and Fushou Zhang. Everyone was worried about Xiao Tianyao 's life and death. People in the capital kept about him.


The bustling capital on weekdays became depressed because of it. The people in the capital seem to have lost their vitality at the moment, and the smile on their faces disappeared instantly. Many people spontaneously went to the temple to pray for Xiao Tianyao.


The Emperor’s purpose was achieved!


When Lin Chujiu learned of the situation outside, she couldn’t help but praised him: “The emperor’s move is very beautiful, he successfully diverted everyone’s attention.”


“The news came too coincidentally. If I knew this would be the case, we should have sent out the rumors about the crown prince and Princess Fushou Zhang a bit later, so that the emperor would have a headache.” Su Cha was very depressed. He finally sent out a rumor that even the emperor couldn’t handle, but as a result… …


As soon as the front line battle report came out, his previous efforts became a waste.


Lin Chujiu gave Su Cha a bad look: “You are too greedy. We want to destroy the crown prince and lessen the influence of the emperor. The rumors about the crown prince and Princess Fushou Zhang have spread fiercely that the effect becomes exactly like that.”


There were so many messed up events happening in the royal family. There were many cases about the emperor controlling the son and daughter-in-law, or the emperor controlling his ministers and wife. Rumors like this also spread. But which emperor was abolished because of such things?


“I’m happy to see the emperor making mistakes.” Thinking of the emperor’s anger when the rumors, Su Cha was very happy.


Unfortunately, he didn’t get a chance to be happy for a long time.


“I … understand!” Lin Chujiu looked at the sky: Xiao w.a.n.gfu and the emperor reached the point where they are willing to hurt themselves as long as they can make each other unhappy?


“Princess, what do you mean?” Su Cha was confused. Did he say anything?


“I understand … your mood.” Lin Chujiu seriously said. And because she was afraid for Su Cha to continue pursuing the topic, she decisively s.h.i.+fted the topic: “Is there anything else? I won’t see you off.”


“Yes …” Su Cha has become accustomed to Lin Chujiu’s various abandonment. He just took out an ebony box like a treasure, and then said serenely: “w.a.n.gfei, w.a.n.gye’s reply to you are all in this box! ”


“w.a.n.gye is out of danger?” He actually wrote back to her? Did he get a sugar candy so he stopped sulking?


Before she wrote so many letters, but Xiao Tianyao didn’t reply to her. Unexpectedly, she just said one sentence, and Xiao Tianyao replied to her, and it’s not just one.


Su Cha vigorously nodded his head: “w.a.n.gye is okay. It is estimated that the news will reach the capital in 2 days. By then, the people in the capital will have something else to talk about.”


It’s a pity that the rumors about the crown prince and Princess Fushou Zhang can’t continue!


Lin Chujiu didn’t bother to think about Su Cha’s words, she grabbed the box in his hand and then waved her hand: “You can get out!”


He was typically discarded after being used up… …

No spoilers, please!
Nannou Yao’s foundation was very good. Although her injury was very serious, after treating it properly and having a good rest, Nannuo Yao woke up the next day.


When she found out that her body feels different, Nannuo Yao immediately understood that not only her wound was treated, but also her hidden disease. Lin Chujiu treated it.


Nannuo Yao sarcastically smiled: “Lin Chujiu, you are really a saint. I provoke you all the time, but here you are treated me. What are you thinking?”


Nannuo Yao found out that she really couldn’t understand Lin Chujiu. If she was like the rumors said, she will not treat anyone hostile to her, left alone kept her enemy’s secret.


“Does Xiao w.a.n.gye like you because of your innocence and kindness?” Nannuo Yao laughed as soon as she said those words.


If Xiao Tianyao likes naive and kind women, then he is not Xiao Tianyao.


“Lin Chujiu, I really don’t understand you, but don’t think I am grateful to you. This is just part of our deal. As for leaving the East Country? Rest a.s.sured … I will do it.”


Nannuo Yao said and then sneered. Her eyes didn’t show any trace of grat.i.tude. Her twisted pale face looked so scary. When the maidservant saw her facial expression, she secretly sighed and said nothing… …


Their princess has always been so selfish, they have long been used to it!


*


Lin Chujiu didn’t know Nannuo Yao’s thoughts, but she knew Nannuo Yao was not grateful to her. After completing the medical system’s mission, Lin Chujiu didn’t go to see Nannuo Yao again. She only sent the medicines she needed. Whether her wound improves or not, Lin Chujiu doesn’t care about it.


Well, in fact, Lin Chujiu just doesn’t have time to care. The rumors about the Crown Prince and Princess Fushou Zhang didn’t subside because of her departure. Instead, their drama heated more and more.


Just like what Zhou Mi had guessed, when the emperor sent Princess Fushou Zhang away that night, people thought he was heartless.


Su Cha hasn’t made another move, but the relations.h.i.+p between the Crown Prince and Princess Fushou Zhang spread with different versions in the whole capital.


Of course, these people, who spread rumors were very smart. They didn’t directly say that it was the Crown Prince and Princess Fushou Zhang. They changed the names with someone else.


In the East Country, people have freedom in speech. Ordinary scholar students have the right to discuss politics. Under normal circ.u.mstances, the court does not interfere with the people talking about politics, but this doesn’t mean people can openly discuss the royal family’s matter.


In the beginning, the emperor wanted to use mild means to eliminate rumors. Unfortunately, the effect was not obvious, and the rumors became more and more ugly. The emperor had no choice but to use the next strategy and directly order the government to take people.


Even under the emperor’s command, the rumors about the Crown Prince and Princess Fushou Zhang continued to spread. It didn’t affect everyone’s eyes about the issue. People even thought that because the imperial family used their influence, the Crown Prince and Princess Fushou Zhang’s adultery must be true.


The emperor was very angry. He knew that this has something to do with Lin Chujiu. However, he couldn’t find any evidence. The rumors just kept spreading in the market place. As for who instigated it, no one knew.


In the past few days, the civil and military officials felt that the emperor was in a bad mood. All of them were frightened, no one dared to mention the rumors. Even the few upright ministers who want to impeach the crown prince shut their mouth.


They don’t want to add fuel to the fire.


In this case, of course, Lin Chujiu didn’t dare to make trouble. She obediently stayed in Xiao w.a.n.gfu and waited for the heated show to pa.s.s.
